# Contributing to blixxar

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to **blixxar**! This document outlines the process for contributing code, suggestions, bug fixes, and other improvements to the project.

## Getting Started

To start contributing, follow these steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository

Before making any changes, **fork** the repository to your own GitHub account. You can do this by clicking the "Fork" button at the top of the repository page.

### 2. Clone the Forked Repository

Once you've forked the repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiruthikpurpose/blixxar.git
```

Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

### 3. Create a Branch

To keep your work organized, create a new branch for your contribution. Name it something that describes your work, like `fix-navigation`, `add-feature-x`, or `update-UI`.

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

### 4. Make Changes

Make your changes in the appropriate files. You can modify existing functionality, add new features, or fix bugs. Make sure you:
- Follow the existing code style.
- Write clear and concise comments when necessary.
- Ensure your code does not break any existing features.

### 5. Test Your Changes

Make sure that any changes you make work as expected. Test your changes locally before submitting a pull request. If possible, add test cases or verify that existing features still work.

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Once your changes are ready, commit them with a meaningful commit message. Follow this structure:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Short description of your changes"
```

**Commit Message Guidelines**:
- Keep your message short and descriptive.
- For large changes, explain what you've done in the body of the commit message.

### 7. Push to Your Fork

After committing, push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 8. Create a Pull Request

Once your branch is pushed, go to the original **blixxar** repository on GitHub, and you'll see a button to create a **Pull Request** (PR). Click it and fill in the details about your contribution. 

Please provide:
- A **title** that summarizes your changes.
- A **description** that explains what your changes do, why they’re necessary, and any additional context.
